This project is intended to demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML and CSS principles.

In this project, I will be re-creating the Google Homepage. Functionality and links may not work, as described in the project goals. However, the design and functionality should remain otherwise.

This project is created under the guidelines of The Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com)
